sensors:

tools used to test sensor:

sensors Toolbox(best tool able to test Accelerometer gyroscope,lux,proximity,magnetic gravity,rotation...)
sensors multitool

command used to know the diffenrent sensors:

adb shell pm list features  # display all phone features with sensors


To get raw acceleration data along the three axes:

adb root
adb shell
root@system:/ # find / -type d -iname "sensors"
/sys/devices/virtual/sensors
/sys/class/sensors

The '/sys/class/sensors' directory contains:

root@android:/ # ls sys/class/sensors                                          
accelerometer_sensor
barometer_sensor
gyro_sensor
light_sensor
magnetic_sensor
proximity_sensor

TO get touch axes:

	adb shell
	getevent
##touch the display screen will show u some axes
